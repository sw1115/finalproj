# Final Project for PPOL-670

This is the public repository for final project, PPOL 670.

## Which *Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)* are linked in the country's *National Determined Contributions (NDC)* document?  

### Introduction
This project aims to use supervised machine learning model to identify potential alignment between the targets, actions, policy measures and plans in countries' Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  



And three supervised machine learning models will be used here: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Neural Network. The Random Forest model with number of trees equals to 100 will give us the largest accuracy, which is
